                        1. Easy: WordPress is so easy, your mom could do it.
                        It’s quick and easy to install. It’s simple to use. You
                        don’t need to know how to code, you don’t need to learn
                        a complicated program and you don’t need to call in an
                        expert for the basics. Things can get complicated with
                        ecommerce, so it’s important to start simple. You want a
                        backend system that’s easy for clients to figure out and
                        hard for employees to screw up.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        2. Flexible: WordPress has the flexibility to do almost
                        anything you want. You can change the look of your site
                        by clicking on a new theme. You can add new
                        functionality with plugins. Ecommerce is a fast-moving
                        business and you don’t want to be stuck with a rigid
                        site that can’t keep up.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        3. Inexpensive: Let’s just say it: WordPress is highly
                        compatible with cheapskates and penny pinchers. You only
                        pay for what you need. If you’re setting up an ecommerce
                        site, that might mean buying a plugin, a theme and any
                        required add-ons. All are relatively inexpensive,
                        one-time purchases, especially compared to pricey
                        monthly subscription ecommerce solutions. They’re also
                        developerfriendly, which means if you have high-end
                        aspirations, a developer can build cool stuff on top of
                        them, saving loads of time and even more money over the
                        long haul. Let’s be clear: WordPress isn’t completely
                        free. You still have your domain name registration and
                        hosting costs. You’ll likely have larger upfront costs
                        compared to a monthly service shop, but over time, a
                        WordPress-powered shop can be cheaper. You could still
                        break the bank with WordPress, but you have the option
                        to pinch those pennies and still get a solid site. Good
                        luck doing that with anything else.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        4. Expandable: In the brick and mortar retail world,
                        it’s always nice to be able to expand your shop as your
                        business grows, but it’s not always an option. The same
                        is true with an ecommerce site. Some ecommerce solutions
                        can’t grow with you and require you do the online
                        equivalent of moving your business if you want to
                        expand. Those kinds of changes cost both time and money.
                        But a site that can start small and grow big—like
                        WordPress—saves you time and money.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        5. Community: The massive WordPress community is a major
                        bonus. Some people look to the widespread usage of
                        WordPress as a reason to stay away. Popularity makes it
                        a target for hackers, right? Perhaps, but that also
                        means there’s swift justice from a large, active and
                        involved community. Besides, most hacked WordPress sites
                        were running old versions of WordPress that didn’t have
                        the latest security updates. The WordPress community
                        also delivers a wealth of plugins, advice and even help.
                        It’s likely you can even find a local community of
                        WordPress fans in your area, eager to share their
                        wisdom.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        6. Content Management System: One of the best reasons to
                        use WordPress as an ecommerce platform is because it’s
                        already so good as a content management system, or CMS.
                        This is another reason some folks dismiss WordPress as
                        an ecommerce solution—it wasn’t technically built to do
                        ecommerce. That’s true, WordPress is inherently a
                        content management system. However, it has two things
                        going for it:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        • It’s one of the best content management systems out
                        there. If your store is anything more than just a
                        storefront—if you want a blog, for example—you’ll want a
                        content management system with some muscle.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        • Focus: WordPress was built as a content management
                        system and that’s all they focus on. WordPress ecommerce
                        plugins were built to do ecommerce and that’s all they
                        focus on. Everybody is doing what they do best, which
                        gives you the best of both worlds. As opposed to a
                        purely ecommerce platform that tacks on blogging or page
                        editing as an afterthought.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        7. Ownership: One of the most reassuring reasons to use
                        WordPress for your ecommerce site is that you own it.
                        You’re not signing on to some indecipherable terms of
                        service. You’re not shackled by someone else’s hosting,
                        servers or limitations. There are a lot of ecommerce
                        services that can launch quickly and handle the
                        headaches for you—but they own your store. You pay a
                        premium for not owning it, flushing money down the drain
                        in extra fees and losing the control to do whatever you
                        want. But not with WordPress. If you build it with
                        WordPress, you’re in charge.
