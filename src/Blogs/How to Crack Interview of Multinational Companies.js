                      first thing that shapes an opinion about you. Wear formal

                      truth .body language in a job interview gives the
                      interviewer a great deal of information that is not
                      conveyed by the spoke word alone. It reveals whether the
                      candidate is confident,goal oriented, and focused or
                      indeed whether the candidate might actually be bourd
                      insecure or nervous. Make a solid first impression. Your

                      Be an active listning Active listning in an interview show
                      you are present, interested and activity part of the
                      conversation ,not thinking about the next answer you want
                      to give or the next question you hope ask. Active listning
                      during an interview is critical to keep the cummnicate
                      open and straight forward. Maintain eye contact with the
                      speakers. Visualize what the speaker is saying. Limit
                      judgment. Don’t interrupt. Wet for a pause to ask
                      question. Ask clarifying question. Empathize with the
                      speaker. Pay attention to non verbal cause.

                      Confidence Confidence matter because it shows that you
                      trust your own abilities. You know you can do the job and
                      you know will be an assest to the company.specific skills
                      can be thought but you have to prove that you are able to
                      learn and apply them. Back up your achivements. Ask
                      question during interview not just at the end. Talk about
                      your mentors. Relax and be the best you.
