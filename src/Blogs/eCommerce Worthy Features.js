                      As we’ve explored building an ecommerce site with
                      WordPress we’ve covered taxes, shipping, discounts and
                      payment options. Those are some big-ticket items, but
                      there are other cool features you’re going to want in your
                      ecommerce site. Here’s a sampling of must-have features:
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Inventory Tracking: One must-have feature for ecommerce
                      sites that want to run with the big boys is inventory
                      tracking. We’re talking SKUs, bulk product updating and
                      even sending notifications when you’re running low on a
                      popular item.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Variants & Add-Ons: Sometimes your products can get
                      complicated with different options and extras. Variants
                      might include size or color options—something that doesn’t
                      require an entirely separate product listing. Add-ons are
                      extras that might go nicely with whatever the customer is
                      buying. It’s basically an up-sell option, but one that’s
                      tied closely to a specific product. For example if you
                      sell yo-yo’s, an obvious add-on is extra yo-yo string.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Related Products: Another popular cross-selling feature
                      is to show related products.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Customer Accounts: One standard ecommerce feature is to
                      allow customers to create their own login. This can speed
                      up repeat purchases, but you have to be careful about
                      requiring customers to log in—forcing customers to create
                      an account can kill their purchase.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Product Types: What kind of products are you selling?
                      Physical, virtual, services, downloads, donations,
                      subscriptions, membership? Not every store is simply
                      shipping goods. If you’re selling something different—or
                      one day might—you’ll need to make sure your plugin can
                      handle it. Some are better suited and offer special
                      features for different types of products (like managing
                      download links).
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • WordPress Integration: How easily can you integrate with
                      WordPress? You should be able to seamlessly plug your
                      products across your site. Use simple short codes on pages
                      or posts, or use widgets across your site to highlight
                      products, show off bestsellers, related products and more.
                      Any respectable plugin should make this easy.
                      <br />
                      <br />• International: Will you be selling worldwide?
                      Better make sure your plugin can handle translation and
                      localized numbers, dates and currency formats.
