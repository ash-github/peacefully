                      Motivation is commitment to something you want that you’re
                      having a tough time with. That commitment must be to
                      yourself, not anyone else. Successful people commit to
                      achieving goals. It will take you places you could only
                      dream of now. One day you will get to look back and see
                      the fruits of your commitment. Spend more time thinking
                      about what motivates you. Motivation isn’t something that
                      you can create on demand for any purpose but is something
                      inside you that propels you to a result. Whether it’s a
                      particular subject, activity, or even a process that you
                      enjoy working through, use that as a starting point.
                      Sometimes it’s hard to look inside and find out what you
                      want for yourself. In life, there are lot of things that
                      we need to do that we don’t want or we don’t actually
                      love, but we know we need to do it for living or for
                      taking care of ourselves.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Some points that motivate yourself to be successful in
                      your life
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      · Take Action We dream of success, but few really take the
                      action needed to achieve the success they really want.
                      Think about it… it’s the people who take action to reach
                      their goals that truly succeed in life. It can be
                      overwhelming to take on, but when you start out simple and
                      start taking action, anything is achievable. Make a
                      decision as to where you want to go and take the next
                      action followed by the next action and the next. It really
                      can be as simple as that.

                      · Find Mentors There are many people in the world that can
                      motivate and uplift others, which is a very incredible
                      gift. A good mentor will have your best interests in mind,
                      and will help you to reflect on what you’re good at and
                      the kind of work you enjoy. They can also help you make a
                      plan to get more of the things you enjoy into your working
                      life, give you the confidence to make changes, and help
                      keep you on track.

                      · Positivity For a healthy and happy life, positivity is
                      must in your behavior, in no situation, one must get
                      negative attitude. Train your mind to see the good in
                      everything. Positivity is a choice. The happiness of your
                      life depends on the quality of your thoughts. Once you

                      · Always Remember Your Goal If you want to be happy, set a
                      goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy
                      and inspires your hopes. Goals should never be easy, they
                      should force you to work, even if they are uncomfortable
                      at the time. Goals are not only absolutely necessary to
                      motivate us. They are essential to really keep us alive.
                      Whenever you feel that you are losing in your aim, just
                      remember your goal.
