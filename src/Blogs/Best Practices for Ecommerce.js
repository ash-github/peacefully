                      We’ve talked about why you should and shouldn’t use
                      WordPress for ecommerce. We think it’s a great way to go.
                      But as with any choice, you’ll need to optimize all the
                      variables. Below are some best practices to make your
                      ecommerce site a success:
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Good Photos: High quality, zoomable product images from
                      multiple angles are a must. One of the frustrations of
                      shopping online is you can’t always see what you’re
                      getting. Give ‘em a good show. This will help minimize
                      returns and complaints.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Product Videos: Take it a step beyond photos and offer
                      video of your products. Give your customers a bigger,
                      better view of what they’re buying.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Descriptions: Your product descriptions need to be well
                      written, engaging and informative. Don’t just stick with
                      the dull copy from the manufacturer. While detail is good,
                      don’t make them too long. It’s a product description, not
                      a blog post.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Titles: Write titles as people would search for them and
                      you’ll get an improved rank in search engines, plus better
                      sales.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Transparent Policies: Instill confidence by having
                      clear, easy to read and readily available policies, FAQs
                      and procedures regarding returns, defects, items that
                      never arrive, etc. You want to put people at ease so
                      they’re willing to do business with you.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Simple Registration: Registration needs to be simple,
                      quick and voluntary. Don’t force people to do it and offer
                      an incentive when they do (it could be as simple as $1 off
                      their current order).
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Short Process: The checkout process shouldn’t drag on
                      and on. Make it short and quick. Only ask for what you
                      need to complete the process. Some stores like to put all
                      the options on a single page and others like to break it
                      into a few steps. But keep it short and simple.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Clear Contact Info: How can customers contact you if
                      they have a question? Make contact info clear and easy to
                      find. If you really want to impress customers, offer a
                      phone number for immediate answers.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Answer Questions Quickly: You need to answer questions
                      as soon as possible. Customers are ready to buy but
                      they’re waiting on you to answer their questions. Don’t
                      make them wait.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Stats: Have good stats so you know what people are
                      buying, where they’re coming from, what’s hot and what’s
                      not. Google Analytics can provide some of this. Your
                      ecommerce plugin should provide more. An especially handy
                      stat is search queries so you can see what people search
                      for and add keywords and items to help them find what they
                      want.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      • Big Buttons: Customers like big buttons. Make your “buy”
                      buttons large, prominent and above the fold.
                      <br />
                      <br />• Make People Happy: Anyone can stick a product in a
                      box and drop it in the mail. But standout service will win
                      you customers for the long haul.
