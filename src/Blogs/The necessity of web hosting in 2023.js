                Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website or web page onto the internet.

Websites are hosted on servers, which is powerful hardware that collects websites and data related to those sites. Every component of your website is stored on a server and is accessed through a web host.
Take examples like files, text, images, videos – everything. Servers are physically located in data centers, which are run and managed by different web hosting companies.
<br/><br/>
Types of Web Hosting

All servers are different. That’s why different web hosting options exist. Multiple websites might share a single server. Meanwhile, some websites have a server to themselves.

There are four types of web hosting:

1) Shared Hosting
2) VPS (Virtual private server) hosting
3) Dedicated Hosting
4) cloud hosting

reseller hosting and wordpress hosting are also specific types of hosting that fall within these categories. We cover all six types of web hosting.

How to know which hosting option is best and trusted for your website?

The types of servers you choose gives an impact on the performance, security, scalability, and management level of your website.
it’s also worth noting that different hosting offers at varying price points. So you must find the option which is in your budget.
<br/><br/>
Shared hosting

Shared hosting is the most basic type of web hosting. It’s cost-effective and the best choice for small or entry-level websites. As the name implies, websites using shared hosting will be sharing resources with other websites on a singular server.
<br/><br/>
Shared web hosting pros:

1) Easy to set up.
2) No need for technical knowledge required.
3) It is beneficial for beginners and small websites.
<br/><br/>
Shared Web hosting cons:

1) Our resources can get shared with other websites.
2) There are issues in performance and sometimes it is out of control.
3) It takes time to load our website.

<br/><br/>

VPS Hosting

1) VPS stands for “virtual private server”. This is a step above shared web hosting.
2) Still your will be sharing a single server with other websites. However, the number of sharing websites will be significantly lower.
3) These virtual servers can be customized by individual websites.
<br/><br/>
VPS hosting pros:
1) dedicated server resources
2) we can make custom configurations to your server.
3) Higher uptime rates and faster loading speed.
4) It is cost-effective than a dedicated server.
<br/><br/>
VPS cons
1) Our main server is shared with other websites.
2) It is not easy to set up as a shared server.
3) It has a limitation in terms of controls
<br/><br/>
WordPress Hosting

Normally you’ll see two different types of WordPress hosting offered by providers.
1) shared WordPress hosting
2) Managed WordPress hosting

WordPress hosting provides security that is specifically designed for websites that are running on WordPress. Since WordPress is the most commonly used CMS across the globe, those websites are at a higher risk for cybercrime. So that added security is a great benefit.
<br/><br/>
Dedicated Hosting

These servers are considered the best in web hosting. You get more benefits with dedicated hosting too such as more uptime and faster speeds.
<br/><br/>
Dedicated hosting pros:

1) You have complete control over the server.
2) Your resources could not be shareb with any other websites.
3) It has high security
4) It has fast load times, high uptimes, and optimal performance.
<br/><br/>
Dedicated hosting cons:

1) It is the most expensive type of web hosting.
2) It requires you to have technical knowledge.
3) You’ll be responsible for every problem.
<br/><br/>
Cloud Hosting

cloud hosting can also be considered as hybr/id version of VPS – but more cost-effective.
<br/><br/>
cloud hosting pros:

1) Pricing is not always fixed.
2) More traffic can increase costs.
3) You’ll have limited customization.
<br/><br/>
Reseller Hosting

This hosting involves selling hosting services to clients. But it is not for everyone. If you’re building a small website from scratch or just looking to host a website on your own, it’ll not be approved.
<br/><br/>
Reseller hosting pros:

1) We can set our own prices to the clients.
2) Get a good and sustainable income.
3) You can improve your existing services.
<br/><br/>
Reseller hosting cons:

1) It takes a lot of time to make your time and effort worthwhile.
2) Your clients might shout at you if something goes wrong.
