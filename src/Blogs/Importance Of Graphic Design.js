                  What is Graphic Designing?

Graphic design is an art by which we can communicate with people through our images, words & ideas. Specially we can give effects and show our creativity. By using the tools of graphic designing, we can make websites, banners, posters, fliers etc.

But Graphic design is not in black & white colors. If we want to make a good design, then it is necessary for us to know the elements and the principles of graphic design.

 
<br/><br/>
Elements of Graphic Design

        Elements of Art are very important for any design. Through this we can give a structured design and visual message to the people. The elements of graphic design are :
<br/><br/>
Line – The most important is the line. Lines can be straight, curved, thin, thick, two – dimensional, three – dimensional and soo on. Line is such an element of design from which we can define our point.
<br/><br/>
Shape – A shape is a two – dimensional defined area created by lines. There are different types of shapes include abstract, geometric ad organic shapes , these are all basic elements of design.
<br/><br/>
Color – Color is such a useful element that we can make our design attractive. through color we can get the attention of the people. Because colors are associated with emotions. There are three main characteristics of colors : color of family, value ( how light or dark the color is ), and saturation ( the purity of the color ).
<br/><br/>
Typography – Typography is the art of arranging type. It is so important that it will impress the design message. Different weights ( Bold,  regular or light ) combined with varied sizing , color, and spacing . It is necessary to add power to the concept so that the designer can communicate easily.
<br/><br/>
Texture – The texture decides how the design will look exactly. For example, texture can be rough, smooth, glossy, soft, hard, etc. Texture is another element used to draw attention.  It can be added to other elements like shapes, colors, images, and type.
<br/><br/>
Size – Size decides how small and large the text should be. And it can indicate importance of sentence, word or line.
<br/><br/>
Space – Spaces refers to the areas of design that are left blank. These areas include any distance or areas between, around, below or above other design elements.<br/><br/>

What are the different types of Graphic Design ?

Graphic design is all around us. Which means there are a range of graphic design specializations. Each type of design requires specific graphic design skills & techniques.<br/><br/>
