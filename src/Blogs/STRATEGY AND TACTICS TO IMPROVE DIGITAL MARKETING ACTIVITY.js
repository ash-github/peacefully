                      Now you have a better indication of where your marketing
                      activities and assets stand in the grand scheme, now you
                      need to look at driving more traffic and push your content
                      out there. You should have an idea of what content
                      performs or not on your site; what kind of social updates
                      generate good engagement rates; what you need to do to
                      compete with your competitors; and, any improvements that
                      you need to make to your assets, that will guide your
                      content strategy.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      WHAT IS CONTENT MARKETING? Content Marketing is the
                      practice of creating and sharing high quality, engaging
                      and relevant content in order to attract, engage and
                      convert visitors. It is the conversation between your
                      brand and your customers through stories. It’s about
                      building long-lasting relationships to current and
                      potential customers, by providing valuable content with
                      the aim to build trust, awareness and engagement through
                      various channels in the digital marketing mix.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      PAID, EARNED AND OWNED MODEL In the previous section we
                      introduced the Paid, Earned and Owned model, which can be
                      very useful in defining your content marketing strategy.
                      For example, a content strategy that overly depends on
                      Adwords PPC and Display Ads to drive traffic would most
                      likely see poorer performance onsite in terms of bounce
                      rate or time spent on site. Organic traffic can balance
                      this, i.e. site visitors who naturally made their way to
                      your site through a relevant search query or interest. But
                      to generate this organic traffic channel, SEO tactics are
                      required. Similarly, an over reliance on free-to-post
                      social channels like Facebook and Twitter might get good
                      interactions with a portion of your target audience, but
                      this interaction might be constantly with the same
                      segment, which does not push your communications out to
                      wider audiences, as such the % of new visitors on the site
                      could be very low, an problem if you have a one-time only
                      product for example REACH, ACT, CONVERT AND ENGAGE WITH
                      YOUR CUSTOMERS This guide to digital strategy aims to get
                      you thinking about how to improve your marketing strategy
                      by considering further activity, channels and platforms to
                      push your strategy into a more advanced stage. The number
                      of options available to you might seem a bit overwhelming,
                      and often there is an element of clarity or simplification
                      required. The RACE Planning Framework by Smart Insights is
                      a useful, simplified outline that helps you to focus on
                      some of the applicable marketing activities at various
                      stages of the traditional marketing funnel that will make
                      your digital marketing strategy a success and achieve your
