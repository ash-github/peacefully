                CodeIgniter is a powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint, built for developers who need a simple and elegant toolkit to create full-featured web applications. CodeIgniter was created by EllisLab and is now a project of the British Columbia Institute of Technology
                <br/><br/>
                
                For building a web application you spend a lot of time writing the same code again and again. Frameworks provide you with a starting block and minimize the amount of code needed to build a website.
                <br/><br/>
                
                CodeIgniter is a PHP driven framework but it’s not a PHP substitute. Diving into CodeIgniter doesn’t mean you are leaving PHP behind. PHP is a server-side scripting language for building dynamic web-based applications.
                <br/><br/>
                
                CodeIgniter contains libraries, a simple interface and a logical structure to access these libraries, plug-ins, helpers and some other resources which solve the complex functions of PHP more easily maintaining high performance.  
                <br/><br/>
                
                It simplifies the PHP code and brings out a fully interactive, dynamic website in a much shorter time. It supports the PHP version of 5.2.6 or newer and MySQL version 4.1 or newer.
                <br/><br/>
                
                Advantages of CI (CodeIgniter)
                
                1. 
                
                CodeIgniter is very simple to configure, as it is an open-source framework
                
                2. 
                
                As per our requirement, we can do customization very easily.
                
                3. 
                
                Those who don’t want to waste a lot of time in difficult coding, as coding in PHP is easy to use, simple and very quick.
                
                4. 
                
                It allows us to well organize the code underlying our webpage easily
                
                5. 
                
                The folder structure used here is linear therefore very easy to use
                
                6. 
                
                It helps in the easy hassle-free migration of server hosting from one to another
                
                7. 
                
                CodeIgniter makes use of the MVC system to simplify the coding, expedient and reusable
                
                8. 
                
                It helps to find out the errors in codes and fix the issues in the web applications.
