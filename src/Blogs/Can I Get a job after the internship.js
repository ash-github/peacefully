                    Yes defiantly you can get a job after an internship,
                    Internships help us to improve our skills and internship
                    teach us how to work in that field in filled we work and
                    also internships provide knowledge about how to work on our
                    knowledge and how to upgrade it. An internship is a golden
                    opportunity for students, now a day any company gives the
                    job to the experience holder, not to the freshers.
                    Internship helps to remove the tag of fresher and gives you
                    the identity of an experience holder. With the help, the
                    student improves their skills. At the time college student
                    gets only the knowledge theoretically Not practically
                    internship allows taking practical knowledge and
                    implementing it in their corporate.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Benefits of internship:- Apply your theory Whatever you
                    learn in school college and university is all theory
                    internship allows you to apply it to projects or how to do
                    that practically. This helps to better understand the theory
                    and most of the students overcome the barrier due to the
                    required experience some college students do not always get
                    with their education.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Get a feel for the work environment For the student to join
                    any company and their team it is the opportunity to see how
                    the company work and how the company teamwork and get
                    familiar with that environment because in future the student
                    joins any company the one of his quality that is families
                    with that working experience he/ she knows that how the
                    company works.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Boost your confidence An internship helps to boost
                    confidence. How does the internship do it? internship help
                    to clear ideas and also helps to explain our ideas. Most of
                    the students can not be explaining their ideas they don’t
                    know how to explain ideas effectively. And students get must
                    idea about their strengths and weaknesses and after that,
                    they can work on that and improve their weaknesses and
                    upgrade themselves.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Build network In that company, you are doing an internship
                    with their team members and colleagues and other members of
                    the company will help you in the future if your nature was
                    good. Students get the opportunity to build their network.
                    As porter Gale wrote, “your network is your net-worth”.
                    <br />

                    Improve your CV Internship helps to improve your CV in the
                    company whatever project you did and what activity you can
                    add to Your CV. They provide great help in letting the
                    students know if they want to pursue a career in one field
                    or not. The internship gives the experience letter that also
                    you can add to your CV.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Getting a reference or letter of recommendation Ones you
                    complete your internship and after that, You go to find the
                    job You don’t know where the vacancies are at that time the
                    company gives you the recommendation. When it comes to
                    finding your first position, reference and recommendation
                    can be the difference between an offer and a rejection.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What happens to me if I didn’t get the internship? It is an
                    opportunity for you to improve yourself and grow your
                    carrier. If you don’t take an internship then you have to
                    face many problems and it is too hard to find a good job
                    also. Internships improve your thinking your skills. Is it
                    possible to land without an internship? If you are fresher
                    then you can’t get the job and Not having any industry
                    experience can make landing a job hard working.
