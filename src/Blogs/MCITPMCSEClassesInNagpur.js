                    Microsoft Certified IT Professionals (MCITPs) have the skills and experience to successfully perform the duties of an IT position – such as Database Developer or Server Administrator – with a concentration on Microsoft technologies of course.

This advanced level of expertise enables Microsoft Certified IT Pros to help the organization increase its technology ROI and maximize performance, often earning them top-tier salaries and benefits.
<br/>
<br/>
The MCITP builds on the skills measured in the MCTS, therefore, you will have earned one or more certifications on your path to becoming a Microsoft Certified IT Professional. Where the specialist-level MCTS cert validated your skills in a specific Microsoft technology, the professional-level MCITP certification confirms your skills in the entire job-role, across multiple Microsoft and non-Microsoft technologies.
<br/>
<br/>
Popular MCITP Certifications:
MCITP: Database Administrator 2008
This certification demonstrates your ability to perform the tasks of a database administrator while managing the Microsoft SQL Server DBMS.

<br/>
<br/>

MCITP: Enterprise Desktop Support Technician 7
These MCITPs can effectively perform the tasks of an enterprise desktop support specialist or help desk technician, including responsibilities like identifying and resolving network security issues, deploying and managing Windows 7, and supporting desktops, laptops and mobile devices across the enterprise. Exam candidates should have experience providing support for 100+ Windows 7 end-users, plus a working knowledge of Active Directory.
<br/>
<br/>
