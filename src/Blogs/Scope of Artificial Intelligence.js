                      AI is the development of computer systems that can perform
                      tasks that would typically require human intelligence,
                      such as learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception,
                      understanding natural language and even interacting with
                      the environment. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a way of
                      associating features such as Learning, motion, etc. that
                      human beings posses with a robot with a computer or a
                      computer-controlled robot. The goal of artificial
                      intelligence is to create systems that can mimic human
                      cognitive abilities in order to automate tasks, make
                      informed decisions and solve complex problems.

                    <h3>What is ML?</h3>
                    <p align="justify">
                      Machine Learning requires structured data as input to
                      learn from and make predictions or decisions. The main
                      idea behind learning is to allow computers to learn and
                      adapt from experience, without requiring explicit
                      programming for every possible scenario. ML algorithms can
                      detect patterns and relationships in data and the use
                      these patterns to make informed predictions,
                      classifications, or decisions. Instead of being explicitly
                      programmed to perform certain tasks, ML algorithms use
                      patterns and data to their performance over time.

                      <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
                      In supervised learning, the goal is for the algorithm to
                      learn the mapping between inputs and outputs so that it
                      can make predictions or classifications on new, unseen
                      data.
                      <h3>Unsupervised Learning:</h3>
                      Unsupervised learning involves training an algorithm on
                      data without labeled outputs. The goal here is to find
                      patterns, structures, or groupings within the data.
                      <h3>Reinforcement Learning:</h3>
                      Reinforcement learning is a type of learning where an
                      agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an
                      environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards
                      or penalties.
                      <h3>Semi-supervised Learning</h3>
                      The algorithm is trained on a mix of labeled and unlabeled
                      data, utilizing the labeled data to guide its
                      understanding of the unlabeled data.
                      <h3>Scope of ML</h3>
                      The scope of Machine Learning (ML) is vast and continually
                      expanding as technology advances and more applications are
                      discovered. ML has already made significant contributions
                      across various industries and fields, and its potential
                      for future growth is substantial. Here are some of the key
                      areas where ML has a significant scope:
