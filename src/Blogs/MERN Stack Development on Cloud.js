                        What is a Full Stack Developer and MERN Stack Developer?
                      </h2>
                      As we move on to our topic i.e.,{" "}
                      <b>Full Stack Vs MERN Stack</b> developer. But have you
                      noticed that there is one word in common in both
                      technologies which is “Stack”? Therefore, let’s begin by
                      talking about stacks; subsequently, we’ll delve into our
                      primary subject of comparison: Full Stack vs. MERN Stack.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <b>What is Stack?</b>
                      <br />
                      Stack is the data structure that works on the principle of
                      Last in First Out (LIFO). Stack consists of two simple
                      operations Push and Pop. Push means pushing an element
                      inside the Stack, and Pop means popping an element out of
                      the Stack. But this is just an explanation or definition
                      of stack. But this concept doesn’t apply to our topic. So,
                      in simple terms, stack means elements placed on top of
                      each other.
                      <br />
                      In the programming stack, different types of programming
                      languages are used to build websites and mobile
                      applications. Different types of programming languages
                      mean front-end, back-end databases, and so on. So, this
                      group or stack of programming languages is used to build
                      the entire website of the application.
                      <br />
                      <b>What is Front end?</b>
                      <br />
                      The front end is an interface that the user interacts
                      with. However, the user doesn’t know how the data is
                      processed and what happens when the user clicks the button
                      on the website or an application. Programming languages
                      like HTML, CSS, etc. are used for the front end.
                      <br />
                      <b>What is Back end?</b>
                      <br />
                      In the back end, all the processing happens. As a user, we
                      don’t know what is happening when we click on the button
                      or when we interact with a website. The process of storing
                      the information in the database will be done by the
                      backend.
                      <br />
                      <b>What is the database?</b>
                      <br />
                      A database is a server where all data information is
                      stored. For example - if you purchased something from
                      Amazon then the product information and the invoice will
                      be stored in the database.
                      <br />
                      <b>What is Full Stack?</b>
                      <br />
                      A Full Stack Developer is a developer who works on
                      front-end, back-end, and database for websites and mobile
                      applications by itself. Full-stack developer has knowledge
                      of all these technologies. Full-stack developer uses
                      different programming languages for front-end, back-end,
                      and database.
                      <br />

                          Communication between the front-end, back-end, and
                          database can be difficult because of the use of
                          different programming languages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Have to learn different programming languages for the
                          development.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <b>What is MERN stack?</b>
                      <br />
                      MERN Stack developer has a simple stack where only four
                      technologies are used for the development of the website.
                      <br />
                      M – MongoDB – used to create a database.
                      <br />
                      E – Express.js – Express is a Node.js backend framework.
                      <br />
                      R – React.js – React is a JavaScript frontend library.
                      <br />
                      N – Node.js – Node.js furnishes an environment for
                      executing JavaScript code.
                      <br />
                      These four languages are used for that’s why it is called
                      MERN Stack.
                      <br />
