                      How Often Should You Post It’s important to remember that
                      internet users need a reason to keep visiting your site.
                      Everyone has a limited amount of time to spend on-line and
                      you need to offer your visitors something that will tempt
                      them away from Facebook for 10 minutes, to see what your
                      site has to offer. It’s important therefore not just to
                      have original content, but also to vary the content
                      regularly in order to entice visitors to return to your
                      site again and again. The question of how often content
                      should be added to a site is one we are asked a lot. The
                      answer of course is as often as possible! In truth the
                      answer depends on the type of site concerned. Obviously a
                      news / information site needs new content on almost a
                      daily basis in order to remain relevant and attract a
                      regular flow of visitors. For other sites perhaps adding
                      just a couple of new pages a month is sufficient to keep
                      the site looking active. Google will penalise sites which
                      simply do not change their content at all for months on
                      end, so whatever kind of site you have you must try to add
                      some new content on a regular basis.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Copywriting vs. Copyrighting  Because good content is so
                      important to the success of your website, consider hiring
                      a professional copywriter to deliver professional copy for
                      your website. Copywriting is the process of professionally
                      written content for marketing purposes. It is not to be
                      confused with copyrighting–the process of obtaining a
                      copyright or legal protection for your unique content.{" "}
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Videos and other Visual Content Effective content doesn’t
                      always come in the form of text. Videos on websites are
                      changing the way important messages are communicated.
                      Website visitors expect to get the information they need
                      without effort. Custom Videos provide a great way to
                      engage audiences and drive important messages in a format
                      that requires less effort than reading large amounts of
                      text. In addition, illustrations, infographics, diagrams
                      and interactive presentations are often used to explain
                      difficult concepts and assist users in their decisions.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Effective Design Statistics show that your website
                      typically has between one and five seconds to retain your
                      website visitor. This is where the design and appearance
                      of your website is relevant. It creates the first
                      impression, captures the attention and engages your
                      visitor to read and process your taglines, dive into your
                      website and ultimately help to make purchasing decisions
                      with confidence.

                      How To Get Content If You Don’t Have Time This all leaves
                      one important question. How do I get content for my site?
                      Clearly one option is to write the content yourself, and
                      if this is something you feel comfortable doing then it’s
                      also the cheapest option. On the other hand many business
                      owners simply do not have enough time to spend on
                      developing high quality and original content for their
                      website. In these situations a professional copywriter may
                      be your best option. A good copywriter will take a brief
                      which outlines the main themes to be discussed, and
                      produce a high quality, well written article covering this
                      theme and incorporating any necessary keywords. Content
                      generation is a form of marketing and like any form of
                      marketing you get out what you put in. A website should be
                      a living breathing document that grows with time and
                      reflects the dynamic nature of your business…. so get
                      writing.
